# Macinpush

Macinpush is a fun reminder for yourself after you've made a push with Git. Looking into how to do it, I came across a similar project git-dude, which is basically a more advanced version of this. The purpose of this project though, is just a fun reminder to take some time for yourself, get some icecream etc, after you've been coding and have contributed to something.

## Usage

Run clone the repo and run the macinpush python file
